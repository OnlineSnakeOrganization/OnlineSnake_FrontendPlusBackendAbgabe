Clone this repository, then, inside the root folder:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
This will run the Frontend and Backend Server.
Both Frontend "OnlineSnake" and Backend "OnlineSnakeServer" have .env Files.
In the Backend .env you can edit the Database URL and in the Frontend .env you can set the URL to whatever backend you want to use.
